## Additional edits

* Fixed .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost class bottom-margin to align with Social Media panel.

<a name="learnings"></a>
## Additional learnings

* How to format a desireable readme file. Just because it's organized on VSC doesn't mean jack to GitHub until you learn some style. I enjoyed it. And no, this comment would not appear in a profile setting/document.
