# Horiseon.com code changes / 14 Dec 2020

## New semantic HTML elements

* Replaced div with nav for header class content due to three page navigation links in header section

* Replaced div with section that combined .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing

* Replaced div with aside where .benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img was concerned


## New accessibility standards

* IMG elements have accessible alt tag attributes & descriptive text

* Figure elements have alt tag & descriptive text

* Added alt tag to hero class for main page img

* Website title updated to Horiseon.com for clairification

* Fixed broken link (SEO)


## Updated logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* Reviewed CSS and grouped together duplicate styles across classes, including
    * .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost
    * .benefit-lead h3, .benefit-brand h3, .benefit-cost h3
    * .benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img
    * .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing
    * .search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img
    * .search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2, .social-media-marketing h2

* Added comments before styling as a guide to 1) what was being styled and 2) how


## Heading attributes fall in sequential order

* Html begins with head & title. Moves to body & header before opening up to h1 & h2 along with nav, sections and their content. The document closes with a footer tag and close of body & unclosed divs.


## Additional edits

* Fixed .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost class bottom-margin to align with Social Media panel.

* Resized IMG files for faster load and better user experience.

## Additional learnings

* How to format a desireable readme file. Just because it's organized on VSC doesn't mean jack to GitHub until you learn some style. I enjoyed it. And no, this comment would not appear in a profile setting/document.
